# There are 4 type of runs to check the assertions 
# 1st is the design in normal run where we check the assertions in the runtime. For normal run execute the following command in the shell
# "make run"

# 2nd is the design in reset where we check the assertions in reset mode. For reset run execute the following command in the shell
# "make reset"

# 3rd is the design in end of process where we check the assertions in eop mode. For end of process execute the following command in the shell
# "make eop"

# 4th is when we blackbox the priority logic. For running the design with priority logic black-boxed, execute the following command in the shell
# "make runb"
